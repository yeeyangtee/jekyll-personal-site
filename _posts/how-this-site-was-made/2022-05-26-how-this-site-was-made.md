## Docker
- No dependencies on your local computer, just need text editor.
- don't want to install anything on my own machines, full remote.
- Bundle up prerequisites and software such as jekyll, ruby, etc


## Installation
- launch cloud instance (linode, AWS-EC2, GCP)
- install docker on cloud instance (link to script)
- Run following commands to pull jekyll image
- Clone jekyll template directory, push to your own git repo
- 

```bash
$ bundle install jekyll # installing jekyll in your machine
$ jekyll new my-site && cd my-site # create new jekyll project
$ jekyll s # run jekyll server
```

#### Adding remote repository

Before we adding remote repository, you must have [github](https://github.com/new) repository, if already have repository, just add github remote address to your local folder, with the following commands

```bash
$ git init # initializing project folder
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git # change UPPERCASE with your own!
$ git add -A && git commit -m "Initialize" && git push -u origin master # push code to github
```

Now check your github repository, make sure the files is uploaded correctly.
